###  My Favorite Animal

***Dyscophus antongilii***

Interesting Facts:<br>

1) Tomato Toads are actually Tomato Frogs but that name just doesn't roll of the tongue. <br>

2) These fellows can secrete a toxin from their skin which can numb an attacking predator's eyes and mouth<br>

3) Tomato Frogs live on average between 6 to 8 years<br>
